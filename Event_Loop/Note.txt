Event Loop Execution Order:

In Node.js, the event loop is a critical component responsible for handling asynchronous operations. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the event loop executes:

1. **Handle Timer Phases**: The event loop starts by checking for timers that are set to expire. If any timers have
 reached their expiry time, their callback functions are added to the execution queue.

2. **Handle I/O Operations**: Next, the event loop processes I/O-related tasks, such as reading from or writing to 
files, making network requests, or interacting with databases. If any asynchronous I/O operations have completed, 
their callback functions are added to the execution queue.

3. **Handle Immediate Phases**: After handling timers and I/O operations, the event loop checks for immediate 
callback functions that were scheduled to execute using `setImmediate()`. These callbacks are executed one by one.

4. **Handle Close Events**: The event loop processes any close events, 
such as `socket.on('close')` or `stream.on('close')`. Callbacks associated with these events are executed if present.

5. **Handle Timer Repeats**: After completing the current iteration of the event loop, it checks for any 
repeating timers (e.g., `setInterval()`). If any repeating timers are due to execute, their callback functions 
are added to the execution queue.

6. **Return to Wait State**: If there are no more tasks to execute, the event loop enters a wait state, 
continuously monitoring for new events or tasks to handle.

It's important to note that while the event loop follows this general sequence, the actual order of 
execution can vary based on factors such as the timing of asynchronous operations, the complexity of the tasks, 
and the nature of the callbacks. Additionally, Node.js allows for customization and fine-tuning of the event loop 
behavior through modules like `process.nextTick()`, which allows certain functions to be executed before 
the event loop moves on to the next phase.
